Q1 - The quantization procedure needs an initial segment division of [0..255] to segments, z. If a division
will have a gray level segment with no pixels, the procedure will crash. WHY?
Answer:
    The reason the procedure will crash is that it will cause a division by zero.
    If in any case, we will get a segment with no pixels - when we will count the sum of pixels in the segment( in the
    formula to calculate new list of q's), we will get a zero number - that we will divide by it.
