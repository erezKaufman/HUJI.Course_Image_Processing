Question 2: What happens if the center of the gaussian (in the space domain) will not be at the
            (0,0) of the image? Why does it happen?

Answer:     As we saw during the lectures/Tirgul - if we would not shift the gaussian to the center of the image, we
            would get the (0,0) index to the center of the image (N/2,M/2 coordinate). it will shift! and why
            wouldn't it be? what we do with the gausian kernel is that we do inner product while in the frequency
            domain so it will be similar of doing a convolution with the image, so in that case, we are focusing each
            time on the pixel in the center, and all the other pixels surrounding it in the size of the kernel. if we
            do not shift the kernel, when we will calculate each pixel, we will also do a shift to the place where
            the center of the kernel is located (N/2,M/2). and voila!
