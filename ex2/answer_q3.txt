Question 3: What is the difference between the two results (Blurring in image space and blurring
            in Fourier space)?

Answer:     there isn't any difference. the result of multiplying a kernel matrix after performing DFT on it and the
            image itself, and then IDFT the result, is similar of doing a convolution between the two
